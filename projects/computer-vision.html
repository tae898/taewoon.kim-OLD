  A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is typically made of multiple fully connected
  layers with nonlinear activation functions. There have been several approaches
  to make them better (e.g. faster convergence, better convergence limit, etc.).
  But the researches lack structured ways to test them. We test different MLP
  architectures by carrying out the experiments on the age and gender datasets.
  We empirically show that by whitening inputs before every linear layer and
  adding skip connections, our proposed MLP architecture can result in better
  performance. Since the whitening process includes dropouts, it can also be
  used to approximate Bayesian inference. We have open-sourced our code, and
  released models and docker images at
