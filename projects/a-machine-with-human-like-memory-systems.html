  ><strong>A Machine With Human-Like Memory Systems</strong></a
>

<p>
  Inspired by the cognitive science theory, we explicitly model an agent with
  both semantic and episodic memory systems, and show that it is better than
  having just one of the two memory systems. In order to show this, we have
  designed and released our own challenging environment, "the Room", compatible
  with OpenAI Gym, where an agent has to properly learn how to encode, store,
  and retrieve memories to maximize its rewards. The Room environment allows for
  a hybrid intelligence setup where machines and humans can collaborate. We show
  that two agents collaborating with each other results in better performance
  than one agent acting alone. We have open-sourced our code and models at

  Inspired by the cognitive science theory of the explicit human memory systems,
  we have modeled an agent with short-term, episodic, and semantic memory
  systems, each of which is modeled with a knowledge graph. To evaluate this
  system and analyze the behavior of this agent, we designed and released our
  own reinforcement learning agent environment, "the Room", where an agent has
  to learn how to encode, store, and retrieve memories to maximize its return by
  answering questions. We show that our deep Q-learning based agent successfully
  learns whether a short-term memory should be forgotten, or rather be stored in
  the episodic or semantic memory systems. Our experiments indicate that an
  agent with human-like memory systems can outperform an agent without this
  memory structure in the environment. The environment is open-sourced at
  <a href="https://github.com/tae898/room-env"
