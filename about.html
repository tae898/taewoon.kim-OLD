<p>
  I love diving into AI stuff! I’m both a researcher and engineer in the AI
  world. It’s like finding the sweet spot between brainstorming new ideas and
  making them actually work in real life. I believe figuring out and improving
  artificial general intelligence is super important for all of us. I’m all
  about open-sourcing projects because it’s the best way to make AI better
  together.
