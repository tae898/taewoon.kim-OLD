[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"The biggest goal in my life is to create a machine that is self-aware. Imagine a world where we live with them. They can help us achieve so many things.\nI like building things from scratch, so that I can document and open-source them. Eventually, the machine I’ll build will be an embodied robot with DC motors, 3D printed parts, sensors, and a speaker. Ideally, computation should happen locally inside the bot without external servers. Reinforcement learning can teach it how to control its motors properly in a given environment. It’ll have its own language model, like we humans do. There is just so much to consider!\nI can’t solve everything at once. I’ll solve them one by one. At the moment, my focus is on the memory of a machine. Endel Tuvling said that through our memory, we are aware of our existence and identity. I want machines to have such a memory system too, just like we humans do. My good friend deep learning will help me get there.\nI know this is a huge field, and I know that I can’t work alone. Let me know if you are interested in what I do!\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/taewoon-kim/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/taewoon-kim/","section":"authors","summary":"The biggest goal in my life is to create a machine that is self-aware.
