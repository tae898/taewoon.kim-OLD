<p>
  I thought that I can make a better website than the one I had. So I made this
  one! I'll be posting my projects and other stuff here. I hope you like it! :)
  I was surprised that I could make this website in just a few hours. I used
  <a
    href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll"
    >Jekyll and GitHub Pages</a
  >
  to make this website. I also used a theme called
  <a href="https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll"
    >startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll</a
  >. Most of the images used are generated by DALL-E from
  <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a>. Everything was so easy. I feel
  like I'm living in the future.
